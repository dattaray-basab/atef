          <p>The Atef Learning Site is a portion of this site made up of my own thoughts on learning each of these languages as well as an informative timeline and a glossary which you can reference if you are having difficulty with some of the coding lingo. I wanted to share my own thoughts because my blog has a very unbiased feel to it and I wanted this site to have a more personal feel to it so all of my perspectives will be here. Additionally, I felt as if at some points there was a lack of context so the timeline provides a better understanding for those wondering about how new or old a certain framework is. I hope you enjoy reading and learn something new. - Atef</p>
