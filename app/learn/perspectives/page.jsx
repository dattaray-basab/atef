          <p>When starting this project I assumed it would be less work then it ended actually being, that being said the workload was still manageable and I learnt a multitude of things along the way. I started off with some basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, however after some planning with my mentor we decided that learning JavaScript would be a good first step on my project.
             I think I would consider myself a novice within JavaScript but I certainly have learnt the skills to at least get started on a JavaScript application. 
             </p>
             <br></br>
<p>Once I had gotten a grasp on JavaScript which is quite difficult, I found that the concept of components and different concepts such as switch-statements and if-statements take a lot of time to understand and be able to apply within your application with ease. Then we ventured into some React.js which I found to be useful, however my mentor and I decided not to go very in depth into it.

Once we looked at those and did more work with Tailwind and  ChakraUI, since Chakra UI was still in development and worked mainly with react, we stuck with Tailwind which worked out well. I think that both Tailwind and Chakra both have a good balance on customizability however Chakra is just slightly more generic and harder to work around. Before this project I was not aware of how much CSS is involved within a site but I am glad that I learnt how to use it.
