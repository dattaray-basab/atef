        Welcome to my Homepage! This site was part of a project I did where I wanted to have different pathways for people to learn different ways of creating websites. I had considered three modern ways of achieving that (Angular Vue and React) and I chose React as it seemed that an increasing number of developers were gravitating towards it of late. React is an open-source, front-end, Javascript framework developed by Facebook. I noticed that NextJS adds back-end capability making React a full stack environment. An alternative for the back-end could have been Remix. I considered different paths of styling this site such as CSS however it is quite low level. Another candidate was ChakraUI which has opinionated widgets which are react components. Finally, I embarked on Tailwind which seemed middle of the ground and well integrated with the React/NextJS framework.
