## ***TypeScript Introduction*** ##
**TypeScript** is a language very similar to *JavaScript*, in fact it is made to improve the developers experience when building a site. It is a statically-typed version of *JavasScript* which can be slightly more difficult to write in. However, it helps developers catch errors much earlier in their site, compared to plain *JavaScript* which is primarily dynamic typing. If you would like a video on the basics of TypeScript, I advise you take a look at [TypeScript Intro and Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahCwqrYpIuM) 

## ***TypeScript Segment Number 2***
As I previously said, writing in **TypeScript** can be difficult and knowing how to debug in **TypeScript** is an essential skill. When getting out all the small errors in your site early you save yourself much of the hassle of having large errors later on in the development process. To learn more about how to debug in **TypeScript** I recommend [**TypeScript** Debugging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56mG7DezGs)
