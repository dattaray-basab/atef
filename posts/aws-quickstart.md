## ***Chakra UI Introduction***

**Chakra UI** is an extremely quick and effective tool to markup react applications and websites. The downside to this is the lack of variation making a site which uses Chakra UI feel a bit generic. There are ways to work around this but it may be easier to use a less advanced markup tool in order to have more variety. Nonetheless **Chakra UI** is a quick and useful tool which is easy to use.

One of **Chakra UIâ€™s** most unique features is its flex component which allows you to shift the sizing and margins very simply and easily.

Creating a grid layout is always a complicated task, however **Chakra UI** provides a really easy to use grid component which I think is extremely versatile and efficient. The edge **Chakra UI** has really shines through here as grid layouts have never been as easy yet customizable.

Having responsive style sheets is an important aspect to have in a website so that it is accessible for multiple different devices, and that the layout will not be ruined by a larger or smaller screen size. **Chakra UI** makes this very simple with premade sizes and features to change colors and other aspects when that size variable is changed. This is something **Chakra UI** clearly has put much work into and it is very simple yet useful and quick.

Lists and list icons are never easy to make, however **Chakra UI** makes it very simple and easy to use lists in your site. There are a variety of different variables of sizes and spaces which you can use with each list, however I think that **Chakra UI** made its list variable to advanced because there is no difference in any applications lists when using **Chakra UI** and it becomes almost obvious that a site was used with **Chakra UI** when you see the lists and how it is formatted. The list icons are also quite generic however you can install third party packages for a wider variety of icons to use.

The card component is a component which is essential in making a site look professional and carefully made. It provides a card shaped box where images and text can be inserted and it can be used as a button to take one to another page. It is a useful tool which **Chakra UI** has and it is fairly standard in comparison to other CSS component libraries. If you would like to learn how to utilize these components I advise you take a look at [Net Ninja Number 7: Card Components]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pExAE289j9s&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9hcnIeryurNMMcGBHp7AYlP&index=7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pExAE289j9s&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9hcnIeryurNMMcGBHp7AYlP&index=7))

The tab component is a feature many people are already accustomed to since it is used widely amongst web browsers. For easy navigation adding in a tab component is a good idea which I would recommend. It is certainly doable with **Chakra UI** and they have a fair amount of variety in this field. It is very well done and many tough aspects are already taken care of, but there still is enough customizability to create a unique UI.

It is highly versatile and has anything that you would need in making a form. **Chakra UI** has many different subcategories for this field and I recommend taking advantage of this feature if you decide to use **Chakra UI**.

## **Chakra UI** ***Segment Number 10***
The toast component is a component which provides a little popup that stays for a duration of time and then goes away. It is commonly used if a task is completed successfully and one wants to notify the user or if there is an error then a toast will pop up and notify the user. With this component in particular it is harder to make it customized to your site and I think **Chakra UI** has over simplified the toast component. Even though it is very quick, usable, and effective it is still quite a generic look.

Avatars are commonly used in many sites and it is a simple way of identifying a user or a certain page. **Chakra UI** has a very easy to use avatar, and since avatars are different there is not a generic **Chakra UI** feel making this component very customizable and fast. There are quick changes and color schemes which you can additionally implement which is also a nice feature from **Chakra UI**.

One viable solution **Chakra UI** provides to work its generic look is the default theme and its customizability. **Chakra UI** runs off of a very simple basic theme which uses a lot of repetitive colors and fonts making it look very generic. In order to work around this **Chakra UI** provides a number of different colors and fonts to substitute for the default settings. This will instantly make your site look less generic and much more unique.
