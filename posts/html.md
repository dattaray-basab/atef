## ***HTML Introduction***
**HTML** or Hypertext Markup Language is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. **HTML** describes the structure of a Web page. It does this by using elements which essentially tell the page how to portray the content being given. It is a very basic and easy to use language, however **HTML's** capabilites are quite limited.

## **HTML** ***Segment Number 2***
In **HTML** there are tags which are the keywords used to describe how a **HTML** page should be displayed. A good video to describe how to style with **HTML** is the [HTML Basic Overview Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qz0aGYrrlhU)


## **HTML** ***Segment Number 3***

To utilize **HTML** to the fullest, one can insert foreign languages into **HTML**. A common example of this is *CSS* (Cascading Style Sheets), which can be used to style a webpage to a much greater extent than what is possible with just **HTML** alone. Another useful language which is commonly used within **HTML** is *JavaScript* which allows for much more features and tools within an HTML webpage. To get started on implementing *CSS* or *JavaScript* into **HTML** I would recommend you take a look at [Adding *CSS* and *JS* to your Site](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGh_zvESdxA&t=434s)
