## ***JavaScript Introduction***

**JavaScript** is a scripting language used primarily by Web browsers to create a dynamic and interactive experience for the user. It enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and many other features. It allows for much more than simple markup languages such as *HTML*. A great full course which provides an thorough and detailed run through of all the essential functions is [**JavaScript** Quick Intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upDLs1sn7g4).

 One of **JavaScriptâ€™s** most useful features is the fact that it can store information, and one way to do this is by using strings. *Strings* are a way to store and manipulate text, and by definition they are zero or more characters written inside quotes. *Strings* are incredibly versatile and can change large amounts of texts to different formats very easily. A good video on strings is [ **JavaScript** *Strings* for Beginners](https://youtu.be/EfAl9bwzVZk?t=916).
